Fivem-Scripte-Collection
The Configs in the Scripts u can delet, they are useless. Most of the Scripts disable some standart GTA things.

Disabled Stuff:

- Stamnina
- Ambient Sounds
- NPCs
- Added Functions:

- Carry
 - Take hostage with notifcation
- RageMP Weaponswitch
- Some simple Scripts they are Selfmade but simple as fuck.

Use the Script as u want but give me my credits most of the Function are simple functions that u can find in the internet. but some function are selfmade.
