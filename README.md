Fivem-Scripte-Collection
The Configs in the Scripts u can delet, they are useless. Most of the Scripts disable some standart GTA things.

Disabled Stuff:

Stamnina
Ambient Sounds
NPCs
Added Functions:

Carry
Take hostage with notifcation
RageMP Weaponswitch
Some simple Scripts they are Selfmade but simple as fuck.

Car taxes
Phone contract
Merge: u can merge them all in one but iam 2 lazy haha. To merge them just create 2 Folders in the collection, 1.cartaxes 2.phone contract. Then move the files from the Scriptsin the created folders and restart the Collection folder.

Use the Script as u want but give me my credits most of the Function are simple functions that u can find in the internet. but some function are selfmade.
